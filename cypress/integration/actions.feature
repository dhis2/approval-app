Feature: Users can approve, accept, unapprove, and unaccept data

    Background:
        Given the admin user visits the app
        Then the user has workflow "Mortality < 5 years" preselected
        When the user selects period "March" of current year
        When the user selects organisation unit "Badjia"

    # These scenarios need to be executed in sequence, because the current
    # available actions depend on the previous ones.

    # In "Ready for approval" state the "Approve" action becomes available
    Scenario: User approves data
        Then the status tag shows the approval status "Ready for approval"

        Then a circular loader is rendered

    # In "Ready for approval â€” Accepted" state the "Unaccept" action becomes available
    Scenario: User unaccepts data
        Then the status tag shows the approval status "Approval by .+ accepted .+"
